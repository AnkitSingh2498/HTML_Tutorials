    <h4>Aside Tag</h4>
    <p>
        The &lt;aside&gt; tag in HTML is used to represent content that is tangentially related to the content around it â€” essentially, a sidebar. It's often used for things like: <br>
            * Pull quotes <br>
            * Ads            <br>
            * Sidebars with related links <br>
            * Author bios <br>
            * Supplementary information
    </p>
  </body>
