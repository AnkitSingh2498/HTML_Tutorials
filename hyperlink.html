    <p>In HTML, hyperlinks are made using the "a" tag â€” short for anchor.
        They let you link from one page to another, or even to somewhere on the same page.</p>
        <pre>The target attribute is used inside an <a> tag (or sometimes forms) to control where the link will open.
            The most common target values:
            
            _blank	Opens the link in a new tab or new window.
            _self	Opens the link in the same tab (default).
            _parent	Opens in the parent frame (if using frames).
            _top	Opens in the full body of the window (breaks out of frames).
        </pre>

        <pre>
        <b>Absolute URL</b> 
            * A full web address.
            * Always starts with http://, https://, or sometimes just / if it's root-based.
            
            <a href="https://www.example.com/page.html">Go to Example</a>
        
        <b>Relative URL</b> 
            * A short path based on where the current page is.
            * No https://, just a path like page.html or folder/page.html.
            
            <a href="about.html">About Us</a>
